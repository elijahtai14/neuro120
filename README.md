# The Vision of our Furry Friends: An Exploratory Analysis of Decoding in Mice

Neural decoding for neurons in the visual cortex in mice attempts to use the firing rates of to predict mouse behavior, or otherwise understand what these firing patterns mean. This project explores many different possible factors that could influence our decoding, trying to understand what decisions could be influential in deciding our decoding model. The explorations performed are: the effect of regularization/dimension reduction, different time-bins, and neuron spatial position on the accuracy of the decoding model. Finally, a visualization technique is proposed as a potential tool to further understand these factors, and discussions speculate about what these experiments could tell us about the inner workings of the visual system of our furry friends.
